# Mipomodoro

A minimal Pomodoro timer app with an animated coffee cup. Enter a task name (at least 3 characters), start a focus session, and the cup fills over the work period. After the focus timer ends, a rest period runs and the cup empties. Focus and rest alternate until you tap **Mark complete** during rest to end the session. You can pause and resume at any time.

## Install

npm install
```

## Start

```

Then open the app in the iOS simulator, Android emulator, or Expo Go on your device.

## Test

npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode:

```
